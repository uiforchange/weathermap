Considerations
● Use Angular latest or 7+ version, ES6, RxJs
● It is ok to use dependency management tools and task runners, but please make
sure your exercise runs simply by opening your main HTML file in a browser.
● Please make sure the delivered package contains an unminified and human
readable version of your sources.

Exercise
Please use Open Weather Data to create a single page application that has 2 sub-pages.
1. Home/landing page: It should display a list of 5 European cities (you can choose the
ones you prefer). Each city should display the city name, temperature, sunrise time
and sunset time. Clicking on this tile should open another sub-page as explained in
point #2 below. (Use routing)
2. For a clicked city, it should display temperature and sea level for the next 5 days at
9:00.

SetUp :

Install depencies using npm install

Run ng serve and it will redirect to http://localhost:4200
